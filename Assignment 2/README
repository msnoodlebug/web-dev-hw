3.) My work cycle for this class is trying to go in order of what to read. I normally look at everything
and all the videos to get and understanding of what to do. Once I start the assignment I will look
up anything that is confusing to me. I do have a lot of issues with markup language. It confusing
to me and  cant seem to get things to look right or upload right but I keep searching for answers until
