<h2> Lyrics</h2>

</div>
<p>
Into the night
Desperate and broken
The sound of a fight
Father has spoken</p>
<p>We were the kings and queens of promise
We were the victims of ourselves
Maybe the children of a lesser God
Between heaven and hell
Heaven and hell</p>
<p>Into your eyes
Hopeless and taken
We stole our new lives
In defense of our dreams
In defense of our dreams</p>
<p>We were the kings and queens of promise
We were the victims of ourselves
Maybe the children of a lesser God
Between heaven and hell
Heaven and hell</p>
<p>The age of man is over
A darkness comes at dawn
These lessons that we learned here
Have only just begun</p>
<p>We were the kings and queens of promise
We were the victims of ourselves
Maybe the children of a lesser God
Between heaven and hell</p>
<p>We are the kings
We are the queens
We are the kings
We are the queens</p>
</p>
